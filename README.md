1. Context: The eSports company (League of Legends) has been losing more often recently, this has affected their sponsorship deals.
2. Purpose: The goal is to identify main factors for winning a game of league of legends, to make the training process more focused on those factors
3. Research questions: what are the key factors to winning a game of league of legends? is there a pattern in win rates based on first kills gotten?
4. Hypotheses: Gold difference is the biggest influence of who wins a game, warding more positively affects win rate, teams with the least dragon kills are more likely to lose.

The challenge i would like to adress is figuring out what factors most influences a win in the eSport/videogame League of Legends.
It is an important goal since knowing what is the most important parts of the game can lead to more effecient training/ more knowledge for the players.
I expect my solution to showcase what factors are the most important to win a game, making decision making easier in game, to increase chances of winning.
The positive impact of my solution would be for Casual users, either people who dont play professionally or professional teams training staff, to easier understand what factors to focus on in game, to increase their win chances.
