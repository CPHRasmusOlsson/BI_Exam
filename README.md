1. Context: A betting company wants to be able to better update their live betting on the eSport League of Legends.
2. Purpose: The goal is to identify main factors for winning a game of league of legends based on the game state at 10 minutes, to make the live betting odds better for the casino.
3. Research questions: What are the key factors to winning a game of league of legends? what are the key drivers of winning a game, can we predict which games will be won from the 10 minute snapshot? are certain features more likely to result in a win?
4. Hypotheses: Gold difference is the biggest influence of who wins a game, kills are more positive than deaths are negative, higher average level than the enemy team equals a higher chance to win.

The challenge i would like to adress is figuring out what factors most influences a win in the eSport/videogame League of Legends.
It is an important goal since being able to predict who will win will ensure the casino has better winnings on bets.
I expect my solution to predict who will win a game based on stats from 10 minutes of gameplay, making live betting more accurate, increasing the casino's income.
The positive impact of my solution would be for business users, the people who update the live betting should have some experience with using BI models/tools for their job, and this would make it easier.
